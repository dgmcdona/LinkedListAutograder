# LinkedListAutograder

An [Autolab](https://github.com/autolab/Autolab) autograder for a Java SinglyLinkedList Implementation.

## Inspiration

As a graduate assistant, I graded 25+ students' Java SinglyLinkedList implementations by hand, searching their code for subtle logical errors. After that painful experience, I decided to write an Autolab autograder package for this assignment, so that students could get instant feedback, avoid errors on the part of the grader, and learn test-driven-development, helping them to write more robust, maintainable, and testable code.

## Contents

This repository contains the Dockerfile used to create the autograder image, as well as the associated source files, grading scripts, and makefiles. You can find information on how to setup the autolab grader in the [Autolab Documentation](https://docs.autolabproject.com/).
